Solution:
Bash can use $'' to specially replace escape sequences with its corresponding
characters. We can use \x20, which is hex for <space> to put a space between
'cat' and 'flag.txt'. We can also define an environment variable that will
hold the entire command and after assignment, which will always be successful
we can && and substitute the command we just defined to display the flag.

CMD=$'cat\\x20flag.txt'&&$CMD
